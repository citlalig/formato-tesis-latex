	Abstract = {Open data has become an important new direction in information technology. Governments are releasing data so as to be more transparent and also claiming that open data has substantial economic value. However, there appear to be many issues about open data that are not being discussed. This paper uses several practical examples in an attempt to illustrate many of these issues and allied opportunities, and through them to suggest the beginning of a research agenda around open data.},
